### Dvorak German Programming Keyboard Layout

This is a keyboard layout based on my personal preferences that aims for efficient typing in English and German as well as granting fast access to programming brackets etc.

Top Left: Default Key / Bottom Left: Shift / Top Right: RAlt / Bottom Right: RAlt + Shift

Thanks to: [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com)

- Dvorank German Type 2 based
- {[]} right under RAlt + qwer
- <()> right under RAlt + asdf
- -_|~ easyly accessable
- äöüÄÖÜ right under RAlt + (Shift) + zxc
- caps lock is mapped to esc unless that has te be done on system level

Supports
- Xmodmap
- Xkb mostly finished - if anyone knows how to map RCtrl to RAlt please hit me up
- Windows in the works
- Mac OS in the works

Special branches exist to make this layout work with 60% layouts (these might be rebased and force pushed any time)
- rctrl_ralt - maps the right ctrl to right alt
- esc_reuse - maps escape to ^ °
- gk64 - does both: rctrl_ralt, esc_reuse
